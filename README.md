# fp-vs-oop-by-example
Functional Programming (FP) vs Object Oriented Programming (OOP) by example. From simple to complex - layer by layer.

Each folder represents a stage of product development, coded in OOP and FP style, with growing features and complexity. Here's the best way to explore and learn from this repo:

1. Go in sequential order for each folder
2. Read the README.md for product requirements
3. Compare the OOP and FP solution for the requirements

## Usage

The programs are written in TypeScript, and have no external dependencies. You can run the code with [Deno](https://deno.land), [Bun](https://bun.sh), [ts-node](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/), etc.

## Problem concept

We will be building a calculator that will do simple operations at first, and evolve to include persistence and composite operations.
