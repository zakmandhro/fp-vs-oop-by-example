Each folder represents a stage of product development, solved with OOP and FP style. To learn and explore:

1. Go in sequential order for each stage folder
2. Read the README.md for problem/requirements
3. Compare the OOP and FP solution
4. Move on to the next stage

## Problem concept

We will be building a calculator with simple operations at first, and evolve it to include persistence and composite operations. 

## Dependencies

[Deno](https://deno.land)
